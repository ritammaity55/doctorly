Getting Started
---------------

1.  git clone https://github.com/ritammaity55/doctorly.git
    
2.  Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:npm install # or yarn install or pnpm install
    
3.  Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and populate it with the required environment variables (see [Environment Variables](https://www.google.com/search?q=#environment-variables) section).
    
4.  Start the Next.js development server:npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm devThis will start the Next.js development server. The application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured).

Technologies Used
-----------------

- **Next.js (App Router)**
    
- **React**
    
- **Neon Serverless Postgres**
    
- **Prisma ORM**
    
- **Clerk (for authentication & authorization)**
    
- **Tailwind CSS**
    
- **Shadcn UI**
    
- **Vonage**
    

Environment Variables
---------------------

Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = <your_clerk_publishable_key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY = <your_clerk_secret_key>
DATABASE_URL = <your_database_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID = <your_vonage_api_key>
VONAGE_PRIVATE_KEY = <your_vonage_api_secret>
```


Security Considerations
-----------------------

*   **Server-Side Authentication:** Clerk handles authentication securely on the server side, ensuring sensitive credentials remain hidden.
    
*   **Environment Variables:** Sensitive API keys and secrets are stored securely in the .env.local file and excluded from version control (.gitignore).
    
*   **Data Validation & Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and data sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
    
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensure that different user roles (admin, doctor, patient) have appropriate permissions and access restrictions based on their roles.
    
*   **Secure Communication (Vonage):** Utilize Vonage's secure APIs for communication features, ensuring privacy and integrity of calls/messages.
    

Frontend Implementation
-----------------------

The frontend is built using Next.js with Server Components for efficient rendering. Layouts and Route Handlers ensure a structured and maintainable application flow. Styling is done using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for a clean and responsive UI. Communication features are integrated through Vonage's client-side SDKs where appropriate.

Backend Implementation
----------------------

*   **Database:** Neon Serverless Postgres, managed efficiently through Prisma ORM for seamless data interaction and migrations, providing a scalable serverless database solution.
    
*   **Authentication:** Clerk handles user authentication and authorization.
    
*   **API Routes:** Next.js Route Handlers are used for backend API communication.
    
*   **Server Actions:** Next.js Server Actions are used to handle form submissions and data mutations directly on the server, enhancing security and developer experience.
    
*   **Communication:** Vonage APIs are utilized for integrating communication functionalities, such as sending SMS notifications for appointment reminders or facilitating video calls between doctors and patients.
    

Deployment
----------

You can deploy this Next.js application to any platform that supports Node.js and Next.js, such as **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js projects), **Netlify**, or **AWS**. Ensure that all environment variables, including those for Neon Serverless Postgres and Vonage, are properly configured on your deployment platform.
